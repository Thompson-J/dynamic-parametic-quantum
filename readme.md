# dynamic-parametric-quantum
1. Setup a web environment with PHP and mySQL and upload the web folder to it.
2. Open Scanner_and_Sender.pde with Processing and an Arduino RFID scanner plugged in and run the application.
3. Register and scan your card.
4. Stop the application, set thiswaypoint to 2, start it again and swipe.
5. Please use the website to retrieve your results and let me know what you think.
When I was at University of Huddersfield, I responded to a brief to create a project from the keywords "dynamic parametric quantum". I loved running and technology so I looked at apps like Strava and Nike+. I took part in coding workshops to gain technical knowledge in RFID scanners and Processing (Java).
The research and development workshops were essential to progressing with my idea: I learnt how to setup the framerate, font, and general appearance in Processing. I produced several small test applications, some that displayed a number as a card was swiped on a reader. I developed this into an application that displayed information in a file, in response to a key press. An issue I corrected was the scanner serial port had two names, depending on the operating system. I solved this with a check for a Mac or Windows.
You can read my code comments for more information about how I solved issues.
